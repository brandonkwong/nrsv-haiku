# nrsv.json

The data used to generate haikus originates from [nrsv-json](https://github.com/brandonkwong/nrsv-json). The [nrsv.json](nrsv.json) _here_ is a sampled version, in order to adhere to translation copyright policies. It contains a sample size of 499 verses, from the first chapter of each book.

## Data Option

For use with custom [data sources](../data), a `--data` option may be used to generate haikus from another JSON file.

```
yarn invoke --data custom.json
```
